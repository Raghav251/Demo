Stop ec2 Instance
Now, let's see the playbook to stop the ec2 instance


---
- hosts: myserver
  remote_user: ubuntu
  tasks:
  - name: Gather facts
    action: ec2_facts

  - name: Stop myserver instance
    local_action:
        module: ec2
        region: "ap-southeast-1"
        instance_ids: "{{ansible_ec2_instance_id}}"
        state: stopped

Here the hosts 'myserver' should be defined in the hosts inventory file.
The ec2_facts gathers information about myserver like the instance_id
The module ec2 is used to stop the instance with state stopped.

Run the above playbook to stop the instance.


ansible-playbook -i hosts stop-myserver.yml -vvvv
